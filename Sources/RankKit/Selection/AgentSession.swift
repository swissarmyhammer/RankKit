/// (`RoutedLLM.makeGuidedSession(_:instructions:workingDirectory:)`), which
/// constrains its output internally but still returns plain text through

/// from a *copy* of the parent's prefilled KV cache. `fork()` below mirrors
/// that one-argument-dropped: this package never needs to steer a fork's
/// working directory, so the seam stays minimal.
///
/// Callers depend on this seam -- never on `RoutedSession` or `RoutedLLM`
/// directly -- so a unit test can drive either against a scripted fake
/// conforming to this protocol, with zero GPU and no Router dependency at
